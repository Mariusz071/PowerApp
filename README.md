This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

PowerApp - web application to monitor and store your gym progress and workouts.

Tools used:
- React JS
- SASS
- Vanilla JS
- json server (temporary solution to ensure server communication is working well)

Final functionality:
- monitor your progress by storing workout / date data in form of separate charts for each exercise
- pre-defined workouts (for now you can insert only your own workouts)
- editing workouts and plans
- to be re-made in React Native

Best regards,
Mariusz
